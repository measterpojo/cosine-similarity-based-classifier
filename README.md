# cosine-similarity-based-classifier
cosine similarity to classify data points. Instead of relying on traditional distance metrics like Euclidean distance, it measures the angle between vectors in the feature space to determine similarity.


Advantages:

Robust to variations in magnitude, focusing on the direction of vectors.
Effective for tasks like few-shot learning, where data is limited.
